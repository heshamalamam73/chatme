Open src/App.tsx and make the following changes:

import { withAuthenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react'
Change the default export to be the withAuthenticator wrapping the main component:export default withAuthenticator(App)

##Attention!
when start deploy the frontend may be sind some error in console for some packages after some search i found the problem in "mini-css-extract-plugin"
the fix idea was

we should install this package
npm i -D --save-exact mini-css-extract-plugin@2.4.5
and in package.json file we should add this line
"resolutions": {
"mini-css-extract-plugin": "2.4.5"
}

after this we can deploy our app without problems ;

##Install the Amplify CLI
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

### phase 2 customize our sign in and sign out form
